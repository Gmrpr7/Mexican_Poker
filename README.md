# mexican_Poker
A variant of 5 card stud poker that is currently unavailable as an online or mobile game. The only difference between this and regular 5 card stud poker is that all the 8, 9, and 10s have been taken out of the deck and 1 joker is used as a wild card. In a straight, the 7 is followed by a Jack. This improves the probability of forming a hand.
